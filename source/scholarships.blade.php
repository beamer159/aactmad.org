            AACTMAD's Scholarships & Grants Program exists to promote the enjoyment of traditional dance, music, and
            song by encouraging individuals to participate in local, regional, and national activities and thereby
            enriching their lives and sense of community through these experiences. These scholarships and grants are
            described below:</p>

                    AACTMAD, as a Group Affiliate of CDSS, is entitled to CDSS Group Affiliate Priority Spots for up to
                    two members to attend CDSS weeklong camp or course events each year. This enables AACTMAD members to
                    most effectively take advantage of the resources and opportunities offered by CDSS summer programs
                    for the benefit of our local community. <span

                <dt>CDSS at Camp Cavell Scholarship: EXTENDED DEADLINE - MAY 31</dt>
                <dd>
                    This new scholarship provides members of the AACTMAD dance community an opportunity to participate
                    in the exciting new CDSS week-long <a target="_blank"

                        Dance, Music, and Spice program at Camp Cavell </a> , Michigan. The intent is to provide funds
                    to those who might not otherwise be able to come to camp. Applications from AACTMAD members received
                    by May 31, 2016, will be processed first, and those applicants will be notified of their scholarship
                    status in early June. All funds may be assigned at that time, but non-AACTMAD member applicants and
                    all applications received after May 31 will be considered if funds are still available. The form
                    should be send electronically to Greg Meisner (gpmeisner@hotmail.com) and Fred Karsch
                    (fjkarsch@umich.edu).

                    These scholarships introduce non-member individuals to our community-based organization of
                    traditional music, dance, and song by providing benefits of a one-year AACTMAD regular membership.

                <dt>Individual Grants</dt>
                <dd>
                    These grants promote the enjoyment of traditional dance, music, and song by our local community by
                    encouraging and enabling individuals’ participation in local, regional, and national activities and
                    thereby enriching their lives and sense of community through attending ongoing traditional dance,
                    music, or song events. Individual Grants pay a portion of registration fees for attendance at local,
                    regional, or national traditional dance, music, or song events, weekends, camps, or festivals. In
                    return, Individual Grant recipients enrich our local dance community with their enhanced skills and
                    enthusiasm for traditional music, song, and dance through specific actions and activities that they
                    describe in their Individual Grant Proposal. A second goal is to encourage AACTMAD members to become
                    leaders in our traditional dance, music, and song community and to gain exposure to and awareness of
                    traditional music and dance leadership opportunities on a regional and national level. Successful
                    proposals will be specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and time bound. Applicants must be
                    AACTMAD members. Preference will be given for attendance at events that provide matching funds
                    through the event’s own grant or scholarship program for which recipients must also apply.
                    Preference will be given to young AACTMAD members and to those who have not previously attended the
                    camp or festival for which the Individual Grant is requested. Financial need is also a
                    consideration.

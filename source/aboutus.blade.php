                <div class="box content">
                    <p>AACTMAD is the the Ann Arbor Community for Traditional Music and Dance, a nonprofit participatory
                        membership organization that enriches people's lives and sense of community through traditional
                        music, dance, song, and related arts.</p>
                    <p>We organize and sponsor over 100 traditional music and dance events each year that welcome the
                        public. Our members actively learn and preserve many different types of traditional music and
                        dance. With over 200 members, mostly in SE Michigan, we also support the traditional music and
                        dance community as a whole, throughout Michigan. We hope you will consider becoming a
                        member.</p>

                    for whom, and at what cost. One-third of the board members are elected each April for three-year
                    terms.</p>

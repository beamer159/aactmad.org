                    <p>The Ann Arbor Morris and Sword Team evolved in 1976, out of the formerly annual Ann Arbor
                        Medieval Festival. Since then we have performed traditional English morris dances in the streets
                        of Ann Arbor and elsewhere. We recently shortened our name to Ann Arbor Morris, but not much
                        else has changed over the years. Our team currently consists of fourteen members. Our dances are
                        generally of the Bucknell tradition, although we frequently experiment with others and even make
                        up our own dances to keep things lively. We hope to see you at some of our performances!

                            Morris dancing is a ritual folkdance that originated in England and goes back to at least
                            the 15th century. (Shakespeare mentions morris dancing in Henry V and All's Well That Ends
                            Well.) As a ritual dance, morris has other purposes besides just plain fun. Fertility,
                            death, and rebirth are common themes in morris. Morris dancers everywhere celebebrate May
                            Day to welcome in the spring.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Morris dancers traditionally dress in all white, wear bells tied to their shins, and carry
                            sticks or hankies. They dance to live music played on instruments such as the accordion,
                            penny whistle, fiddle, and tabor. While many dances have been passed down over the years,
                            new dances and traditions are being developed by teams everywhere.

                            Fortunately, morris dancing is no longer considered a misdemeanor!
